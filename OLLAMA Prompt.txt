You are a database designer. Please create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the operations of a small college.  1. Base entities and relationships (from the academic diagram in class): - STUDENT (attributes: STU_NUM, DEPT_CODE, STU_LNAME, STU_FNAME, STU_INITIAL, STU_EMAIL, PROF_NUM for advisor, TROJAN_ID, USC_EMAIL) - PROFESSOR (PROF_NUM, DEPT_CODE, PROF_SPECIALTY, PROF_RANK, PROF_LNAME, PROF_FNAME, PROF_INITIAL, PROF_EMAIL) - DEPARTMENT (DEPT_CODE, DEPT_NAME, SCHOOL_CODE, PROF_NUM for head of department) - SCHOOL (SCHOOL_CODE, SCHOOL_NAME) - COURSE (CRS_CODE, DEPT_CODE, CRS_TITLE, CRS_DESCRIPTION, CRS_CREDIT) - CLASSROOM (CLASS_CODE, CLASS_SECTION, CLASS_TIME, CRS_CODE, PROF_NUM, ROOM_CODE) - ENROLL (ENROLL_DATE, ENROLL_GRADE, CLASS_CODE, STU_NUM) - ROOM (ROOM_CODE, ROOM_TYPE, BLDG_CODE) - BUILDING (BLDG_CODE, BLDG_NAME, BLDG_LOCATION)  Relationships include: - A STUDENT enrolls in CLASSROOM through ENROLL. - A PROFESSOR teaches CLASSROOM. - A PROFESSOR works_in DEPARTMENT. - A DEPARTMENT offers COURSE. - A SCHOOL contains DEPARTMENT. - A COURSE scheduled_in CLASSROOM. - A ROOM hosts CLASSROOM. - A BUILDING has ROOM.  2. Extend the diagram with 6 new entities and their relationships (to reflect real college life beyond academics): - DOHENY_LIBRARY (LIBRARY_ID, LIBRARY_NAME, HOURS, SPECIAL_COLLECTIONS) → connected to STUDENT through LIBRARY_ACCESS. - TROJAN_ATHLETICS (SPORT_ID, SPORT_NAME, SEASON, COACH_ID) → connected to STUDENT through PARTICIPATES. - GREEK_LIFE (GREEK_ID, GREEK_NAME, CHAPTER_TYPE, MEMBER_COUNT) → connected to STUDENT through MEMBERSHIP. - CAMPUS_EVENTS (EVENT_ID, EVENT_NAME, EVENT_DATE, VENUE, EVENT_TYPE) → connected to STUDENT through ATTENDS. - RESIDENTIAL_COLLEGE (HOUSING_ID, BUILDING_NAME, ROOM_TYPE, CAPACITY) → connected to STUDENT through HOUSING_ASSIGNMENT. - TROJAN_SERVICES (SERVICE_ID, SERVICE_NAME, LOCATION, HOURS) → connected to STUDENT through SERVICE_USAGE.  Additional relationships: - STUDENT joins GREEK_LIFE through MEMBERSHIP, GREEK_LIFE includes MEMBERSHIP. - STUDENT attends CAMPUS_EVENTS through ATTENDS, CAMPUS_EVENTS involves ATTENDS. - STUDENT lives_in RESIDENTIAL_COLLEGE through HOUSING_ASSIGNMENT, RESIDENTIAL_COLLEGE houses HOUSING_ASSIGNMENT. - STUDENT uses TROJAN_SERVICES through SERVICE_USAGE, TROJAN_SERVICES provides SERVICE_USAGE. - STUDENT accesses DOHENY_LIBRARY through LIBRARY_ACCESS, DOHENY_LIBRARY provides LIBRARY_ACCESS. - STUDENT participates TROJAN_ATHLETICS through PARTICIPATES, TROJAN_ATHLETICS involves PARTICIPATES.  Junction tables: - MEMBERSHIP (STU_NUM, GREEK_ID, JOIN_DATE) - ATTENDS (STU_NUM, EVENT_ID) - HOUSING_ASSIGNMENT (STU_NUM, HOUSING_ID, MOVE_IN, MOVE_OUT) - SERVICE_USAGE (STU_NUM, SERVICE_ID, USE_DATE) - LIBRARY_ACCESS (STU_NUM, LIBRARY_ID, ACCESS_DATE) - PARTICIPATES (STU_NUM, SPORT_ID, ROLE)  3. Instructions for output: - Use Mermaid ER diagram syntax (erDiagram). - Start with the exact relationships in this order: STUDENT ||--o{ ENROLL : enrolls, PROFESSOR ||--o{ CLASSROOM : teaches, PROFESSOR ||--o{ DEPARTMENT : works_in, DEPARTMENT ||--o{ COURSE : offers, SCHOOL ||--o{ DEPARTMENT : contains, COURSE ||--o{ CLASSROOM : scheduled_in, ROOM ||--o{ CLASSROOM : hosts, BUILDING ||--o{ ROOM : has, STUDENT ||--o{ MEMBERSHIP : joins, GREEK_LIFE ||--o{ MEMBERSHIP : includes, STUDENT ||--o{ ATTENDS : attends, CAMPUS_EVENTS ||--o{ ATTENDS : involves, STUDENT ||--o{ HOUSING_ASSIGNMENT : lives_in, RESIDENTIAL_COLLEGE ||--o{ HOUSING_ASSIGNMENT : houses, STUDENT ||--o{ SERVICE_USAGE : uses, TROJAN_SERVICES ||--o{ SERVICE_USAGE : provides, STUDENT ||--o{ LIBRARY_ACCESS : accesses, DOHENY_LIBRARY ||--o{ LIBRARY_ACCESS : provides, STUDENT ||--o{ PARTICIPATES : participates, TROJAN_ATHLETICS ||--o{ PARTICIPATES : involves - Then include all entity definitions with their attributes and data types (int, string, date). - Do not use quotes around relationship names. - Include all primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK). - Use proper indentation for entity attributes.  Output only the Mermaid ER diagram code block, nothing else.
